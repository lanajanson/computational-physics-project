Final project from computational physics course using Python and LaTeX

# Investigation of Heat Conduction Phenomena

This project was completed as part of my Computational Physics course at Missouri State University. It focuses on modeling and analyzing heat conduction within one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) systems using numerical methods. The project applies finite difference methods to solve the heat equation and investigates the temperature distribution within a rod and a plate over time.

The project emphasizes the use of Python for computational modeling and LaTeX (Overleaf) for scientific reporting, demonstrating skills in numerical analysis, matrix solving, and data visualization.

## Overview
- Developed numerical models for 1D and 2D heat conduction using the finite difference method.
- Discretized the heat equation and applied iterative techniques to solve for temperature distributions within a rod (1D) and a plate (2D).
- Utilized `numpy.linalg.solve()` to solve matrix equations representing the physical systems.
- Visualized results using Matplotlib for both line plots (1D) and heatmaps (2D).
- Compiled a detailed scientific report using Overleaf (LaTeX) outlining the methods, results, and analysis.
